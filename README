Digital Eraser
==============

Digital Eraser deletes Twitter account data. It is intended to be run via cron
automatically.

Name
----

Radiergummi is German for Eraser.
Google "Digitaler Radiergummi" fr background info.

Description
-----------

Twitter is a (near) real time medium. It doesn't need to keep an archive of
everything I have ever done on there.

Especially since I have my own archive via mail and client logs.

Digital Eraser can delete these things:
- status messages
- retweets
- favorites
- direct messages: sent and received
- blocks
- saved searches
- lists

It is designed to be run via cron.

Warning
-------

This will permanently delete content of your Twitter-account.

Requirements
------------

Tweepy: https://code.google.com/p/tweepy/

Configuration
-------------

Get OAuth key and secret for application and account at:
https://dev.twitter.com/apps

Change the limits-variables to whatever value you want to keep.

Notes
-----

The Twitter API seems to have a hard time with old content. An initial deletion
to the specified limits will take a while.

You will probably see a few tweepy.error.TweepError. These are Twitters fault:
- Twitter error response: status code = 503
- No status found with that ID.
